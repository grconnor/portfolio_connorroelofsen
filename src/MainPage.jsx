        <p>
          I recently graduated from Craft Academy where I had been working in a fast 
          paced environment, on modern applications and real life situations. <br></br>
          Working with a BDD (behaviour Driven Development), TDD (Test Driven Development) and Agile approach during development as it sets the foundation for the application at hand.<br></br>
          Love meeting new people, passing on my knowledge, learning new techknowlogies and perfecting my technological way of thinking and working.<br></br>
          It is often said about me that I'm driven, flexible/mendable,communicative and skilled in problem solving and research.
